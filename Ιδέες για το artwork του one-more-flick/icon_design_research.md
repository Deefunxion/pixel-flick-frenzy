# Game Icon Design Research - Key Findings

## Source: Medium Article - "6 Golden Rules for Effective Game Icon Design"

### Core Principles

1. **Single Element Focus**: The best icons use a single, clearly visible element that captures the essence of the game
   - Example: Monument Valley (character + single platform)
   - Example: Canabalt (single pixel character running)

2. **Limited Color Palette**: Even if the game is colorful, the icon should be paired back
   - Example: 1010 (single red cube despite game having many colors)
   - Example: Merged (simple tricolor icon)

3. **Avoid Text**: Words are hard to read when scaled down and redundant (app name is next to icon)
   - Exception: Massive franchises with huge marketing (Walking Dead, GTA)

4. **Avoid Photos**: Photos don't scale well and contain unnecessary details
   - Exception: Celebrity-endorsed games (but use illustrations, not photos)

5. **Consistency with Game Art**: Icon MUST match the in-game art style
   - Success example: Downwell (cohesive marketing suite)
   - Success example: Super Sharp (cut effect matches gameplay)
   - Success example: Limbo (captures atmosphere perfectly)

6. **Scalability Testing**: ALWAYS test at smallest size (how it appears on device)
   - Users only see icons on iPhone/iPad, not at full resolution

### Key Insights for One-More-Flick

- The game's minimalist, hand-drawn aesthetic is PERFECT for icon design
- Single element focus aligns with "limitation IS the design" principle
- The stick figure player or the arc trajectory could be the single element
- Must maintain theme consistency (Flipbook vs Noir styles)
- Zeno's Paradox concept could be visually represented in the icon

### Additional Core Principles

1. **Avoid Similar Shapes**: Icons with similar shapes look like they belong together/do similar things
   - Take full advantage of shape diversity
   - Each icon should be distinguishable by shape alone

2. **Minimize Complexity**: More elements = less contrast = more effort to identify
   - Keep it simple and clean
   - Avoid jumbled mix of shapes

3. **Consistent Visual Style**: Breaking style rules makes experience feel disjointed
   - Design icons side-by-side
   - Check frequently if all elements belong together
   - Even small style changes can break cohesion

4. **Don't Rely on Text**: Makes icon redundant, unclear at small sizes, locks to single language
   - If text is needed, use as label underneath

5. **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**: Established icons have millions of hours of testing
   - Usability is key
   - Design should serve usability, not stand in its way

6. **Message Consistency**: Same icon should not be used for different functions
   - Use same rules and icons across all pages

7. **Design for Small Size**: Details turn into jumbled mess at small sizes
   - Icons are useful first, beautiful second

8. **Don't Rely on Color**: Shape must be first thing people notice
   - Color can mask design mistakes
   - Consider colorblind users

### Application to One-More-Flick

- Icon system should have DISTINCT shapes for different functions
- All icons should share the same hand-drawn style (Flipbook or Noir)
- Test all icons at small sizes (mobile screens)
- Shape-first, color-second approach
- Avoid text in icons (use labels underneath if needed)
