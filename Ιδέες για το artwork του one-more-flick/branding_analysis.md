# Branding Implementation Plan - Key Elements

## Core Branding Direction

### Visual Identity

- **Tagline**: "one more flick." (lowercase, period included)
- **Core Aesthetic**: Hand-drawn, minimalist, notebook/sketchbook style
- **Two Themes**: Flipbook (warm, notebook) & Noir (high-contrast, film noir)

### Color System Refinements

#### Flipbook Theme Colors
- **Primary**: Blue ballpoint pen ink (#1a4a7a)
- **Background**: Warm cream paper (#f5f1e8)
- **Utility Colors**:
  - Pencil Gray (#9a9590) - Ghost trails, sketchy shadows
  - Erased Pink (#f0e8e6) - Subtle erased areas
  - Warm White (#fff8f0) - Key moments emphasis

#### Noir Theme Colors
- **Primary**: Off-white ink (#e8e4e0)
- **Background**: Deep black (#121216)
- **Utility Colors**:
  - Pencil Gray (#6a6660) - Darker ghost trails
  - Ink Bleed (#3a3a40) - Subtle ink spread effects
  - Warm White (#fff8f0) - Key moments, emphasis

### Animation Systems (4 Core Systems)

1. **Ghost Trail Animation**
   - Fading echo figures during flight
   - Progressive opacity fade
   - Tumbling poses based on velocity angle
   - Flipbook: More ghosts, softer
   - Noir: Fewer ghosts, sharper

2. **Squash & Stretch**
   - Charging: Compress vertically, expand horizontally (anticipation)
   - Flying: Elongate in velocity direction (speed)
   - Landing: Impact compression (weight)

3. **Anticipation Poses**
   - Charging wind-up: Lean BACK before launch
   - Arms pull behind body
   - Lower center of gravity
   - Release snap: Everything whips forward

4. **Scribble Energy Effects**
   - Charging: Vibrating scribble lines around character
   - High charge: More intense, more lines
   - Flipbook: Soft, sketchy energy
   - Noir: Sharp, electric energy

### Character Design
- **Zeno**: Stick figure protagonist
- **Signature Pose**: "Lean" pose (leaning back, anticipation)
- **States**: Idle, Charging, Flying, Landing
- **Personality**: Determined, focused, slightly anxious about the edge

### Asset Requirements

1. **App Icons**
   - 1024x1024 master icon
   - Zeno in signature "lean" pose
   - Theme-specific versions (Flipbook & Noir)

2. **Custom Lettering**
   - "one more flick." wordmark
   - Hand-drawn style matching themes
   - Flipbook: Blue ink, wobbly
   - Noir: Sharp, high-contrast

3. **UI Icon Set**
   - Settings, Leaderboard, Stats, Sound, Close
   - Consistent with theme aesthetics
   - Shape-first design

### Brand Personality
- **Tone**: Minimalist, clever, slightly philosophical (Zeno's Paradox)
- **Feel**: Tactile, hand-drawn, intimate (like a personal notebook)
- **Emotion**: Tension, anticipation, satisfaction (the "one more" loop)
