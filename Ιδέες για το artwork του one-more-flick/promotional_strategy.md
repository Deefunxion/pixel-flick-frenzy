## Implementation Notes

All promotional materials should:

- Be theme-consistent (Flipbook OR Noir, not mixed)
- Emphasize the character (Zeno) as the brand mascot
- Show actual gameplay elements (not abstract concepts)
- Work at multiple sizes (scalability)
- Avoid text-heavy designs (visual first)
