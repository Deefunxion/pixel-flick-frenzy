## Strategic Notes

These materials are designed to work together as a cohesive brand system. The dual-theme approach (Flipbook and Noir) provides flexibility for different marketing contexts while maintaining consistent brand recognition through the Zeno character and the distinctive hand-drawn aesthetic.

The materials emphasize the game's unique selling points: the philosophical depth (Zeno's Paradox), the tactile, hand-drawn feel, and the addictive "one more try" gameplay loop. All visuals are designed to be immediately recognizable even at small sizes, which is crucial for mobile app marketing.

## Next Steps

Consider creating additional materials as the game evolves:

1. **Animated GIFs** showing the ghost trail and squash/stretch animations
2. **Video trailers** featuring both themes
3. **Social media templates** for consistent posting
4. **Press kit** with screenshots and key art
5. **Seasonal variations** for special events

All future materials should maintain the established visual language and brand personality defined in this package.
