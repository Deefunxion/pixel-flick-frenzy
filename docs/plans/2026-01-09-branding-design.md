# One More Flick — Branding & Visual Design Spec

> **Brand essence:** "You know what this is. We know what this is. One more flick."

**Tone:** Winking, self-aware, with darkly comic undertones. The brand knows it's got you hooked — and it's not sorry.

---

## 1. The Character: Zeno

Zeno is THE stickman. Not just a player avatar — a character with a name and personality. He's the one eternally approaching the edge, never quite falling, never quite stopping.

**Personality:**
- Calm, casual confidence
- Done this a thousand times
- Unsettlingly at peace with the void
- Embodies "I'm constantly edging"

---

## 2. Logo

### Primary Mark: Zeno at the Edge

**Composition:**
```
        \o/
         |       ← Zeno, leaning into the void (~15-20° forward tilt)
        / \___________

    one more flick.
```

**The pose (The Lean):**
- Zeno stands on a single horizontal line (the cliff edge)
- Body tilts forward past the point of balance
- Arms hang loose at sides, completely relaxed
- Legs straight, feet together at the very edge (toes may overhang)
- Head faces forward into the void, or slightly turned toward viewer
- Expression: minimal — two dots for eyes, neutral or slightly smug

**The edge:**
- Clean horizontal line, ends abruptly
- Nothing below — the void is empty space

**The vibe:**
- Not scared. Not excited.
- Quiet confidence. Unsettling calm.
- "I live here now."

### Wordmark: "one more flick."

**Treatment:**
- All lowercase
- Period at the end — deliberate, inevitable
- Custom hand-drawn letterforms

**Lettering characteristics:**
- Same pen that drew Zeno (ballpoint feel)
- Stroke width: ~2-3px, varies with pressure
- Slight wobble — human, not shaky
- Rounded corners, no sharp joints
- Slight ink buildup where strokes overlap

**Letter-by-letter:**
| Letter | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| o | Slightly oval, small gap where pen lifted |
| n, m | Humps slightly uneven heights |
| e | Loop doesn't close perfectly |
| r | Simple, almost like 'n' that gave up halfway |
| f, l | Tallest letters, not too formal |
| i | Dot is a quick jab, slightly offset |
| c | Open curve, casual |
| k | Loose, playful kick |
| . | Firm, deliberate dot — the anchor |

**Spacing:**
- Slightly irregular, not kerned to perfection
- Words closer than formal type
- Feels like one continuous thought scribbled quickly

### Theme Adaptations

**Flipbook:**
- Blue ballpoint ink (`#1a4a7a`)
- Cream/off-white background (`#f5f1e8`)
- Visible pen strokes, slight wobble
- Optional: faint shadow scribble under cliff line

**Noir:**
- Off-white/cream figure (`#e8e4e0`)
- Pure black background (`#121216`)
- Same wobble, cleaner contrast
- The void below is just... black. Already there.

### Logo Variants

| Variant | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Full (Zeno + cliff + wordmark) | Website header, splash screen, marketing |
| Compact (Zeno on edge only) | App icon, favicon, small spaces |
| Text only ("one more flick.") | When Zeno is already visible |

---

## 3. App Icon / Favicon

**The icon:** Zeno in "The Lean" pose on the edge — no text

## 5. Icon System

### Design Principles

- **Same hand:** Icons look like they were drawn by the same person who drew Zeno
- **Shape-first:** Each icon has a unique silhouette, recognizable at 16px
- **Theme-adaptive:** Same shapes, different rendering per theme

### UI Icons

| Icon | Shape | Doodle Details |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Sound On | Speaker cone + 2-3 curved lines | Wobbly radiating lines, uneven spacing |
| Sound Off | Speaker + diagonal slash | Slash is quick, confident — like crossing out a mistake |
| Leaderboard | Trophy silhouette | Handles slightly uneven, wobbly star or #1 inside |
| Stats | Three vertical bars (bar chart) | Hand-drawn rectangles, imperfect, different heights |
| Theme Toggle | Half-filled circle | Fill is scribbly, shows pen strokes |
| Close (X) | Two crossed lines | Quick, casual — like marking wrong on a test |

### Achievement Icons

More illustrative, Zeno stars in most of them.

| Achievement | Icon Description | Subtext |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| First Zeno | Zeno planting a tiny flag on a wobbly star | "I made it" |
| Perfect Landing | Bullseye target with Zeno standing dead center, arms raised | Nailed it |
| The Edge Lord | Zeno's toes hanging off, arms out for balance, sweat drops | Too close |
| Fell Off | Zeno mid-fall, limbs flailing, "!" above head | The void claimed him |
| Level 5 | Number "5" with Zeno sitting on top, casual | Getting comfortable |
| Level 10 | Number "10" wearing a tiny wobbly crown | Royalty now |
| Hot Streak | Zeno with scribble flames trailing behind | On fire |
| 100 Flicks | Zeno looking tired, slumped, "100" scratched into ground | "why am I still here" |
| 1000 Flicks | Zeno with coffee cup, thousand-yard stare | "I live here now" |
| Night Owl | Zeno silhouette against a scribbly moon | Playing at 3am |
| The Comeback | Zeno climbing back UP onto the edge from below | Refused to quit |

## 6. Stickman Animation Concepts

Four animation systems to make Zeno feel alive:

### 6.1 Ghost Trail

Fading "echo" figures trail behind during flight.

**Flipbook:**
- 3-4 ghost figures, progressively fainter (60% → 40% → 20% → 10% opacity)
- Each ghost slightly behind in pose cycle (shows tumble sequence)
- Same wobbly blue ink, thinner strokes as they fade
- Slight vertical offset (paper shifted feel)

**Noir:**
- 2-3 ghosts, sharper contrast
- Fade from white → gray → dark gray
- Subtle "smear" connecting them
- Faint scratch line on dark background

**Behavior:**
- Only during flight phase
- Trail length scales with velocity
- Slow-mo: ghosts spread out dramatically
- Full stick figures (not silhouettes)

### 6.2 Squash & Stretch

Proportions change based on forces — the oldest animation trick.

**Charging (SQUASH):**
- Compresses as power builds
- 0% charge: normal proportions
- 100% charge: ~70% height, ~130% width
- Legs bend deeper, head tucks

**Launch (STRETCH):**
- Instant snap to elongated form
- ~130% height, ~70% width
- Arms trail behind, legs stream back
- Holds for ~100ms, then relaxes

**Flight:**
- Gentle oscillation between stretched and normal
- Stretch direction follows velocity vector

**Landing (SQUASH):**
- Soft landing: 90% height squash
- Hard landing near edge: 60% height + rebound
- Fell off: stretches downward into void

**Theme differences:**
- Flipbook: slightly uneven compression (hand-drawn imperfection)
- Noir: cleaner, symmetrical distortion with motion blur

### 6.3 Anticipation Poses

Wind-up before action, follow-through after. Cartoony and exaggerated.

**Idle:**
- Subtle bounce (2-3px up/down)
- Weight shifts between feet
- Head tilts toward cliff edge

**Charge wind-up:**
- Leans BACK first (away from target)
- Arms pull behind body
- One leg steps back to brace
- At max charge: coiled like a pitcher

**Release snap:**
- Everything whips forward instantly
- Arms swing ahead
- Back leg kicks up
- Brief freeze before flight

**Flight poses:**
- Tumbling rotation with trailing limbs
- Peak of arc: "floating" pose, limbs spread

**Landing recovery:**
- Good landing: arms windmill, settle into proud stance
- Close call: arms flail wildly, body wobbles, exhale of relief
- Fell off: arms reach up desperately while falling

### 6.4 Scribble Energy

Sketchy energy lines during intense moments — like a kid's drawing of power.

**Charging:**
- Small scribble lines radiate from body
- Sparse at low charge, dense and frantic at max
- Wobbly, uneven lengths, slightly curved
- Flicker each frame (slightly different positions)
- Max charge: lines vibrate, some spiral around figure

**Launch burst:**
- Explosion of scribbles behind at release
- Radiating star pattern from launch point
- Quick fade (200-300ms)

**Impact:**
- Scribble lines shoot into ground
- Dust puffs = circular scribbles that expand and fade
- Near-edge: extra chaotic, maybe "!" marks
- Fell off: downward streaming lines

**Speed lines:**
- Horizontal scribble streaks during high-velocity flight
- Faster = longer and more numerous

**Theme differences:**
- Flipbook: Blue ink scribbles, same wobble, occasional overdraw
- Noir: White/gray scratchy marks, chalk dust feel, sharper/angular

## 7. Brand Voice

**Tone:** Winking, self-aware, darkly comic

**Characteristics:**
- Knows the game is a dopamine loop
- Not apologetic about it
- Quiet confidence, not shouting
- Period at end of statements, not exclamation marks
- Dark humor about compulsion and addiction

**Example copy:**
- "one more flick."
- "I'm constantly edging"
- "You'll be back."
- "I live here now."
- "why am I still here" (lowercase, no punctuation)
- "The void is patient."

**What to avoid:**
- Exclamation marks (too eager)
- "Fun!" "Exciting!" (too innocent)
- Generic mobile game hype
- Breaking the fourth wall too explicitly
