## What DOESN'T Work (Pollution)

### The "Lean Back" Pose Problem

**Description of the Problematic Pose:**
- Zeno leaning back 15-20° from vertical
- Arms hanging loose behind the body
- Relaxed, casual posture
- Looks like someone "chilling" or "lounging"

**Why It Fails:**
- NO superhero energy
- Looks passive, not active
- Arms behind = disengaged, not ready
- Suggests laziness, not power

**Where This Appears (To Be Replaced):**
- App icons in `public/assets/icons/flipbook/` and `noir/`
- Any branding assets with this pose
- Any promotional materials with this pose

## Asset Replacement Strategy

### Files to Replace/Update:

1. **App Icons** (all sizes, both themes)
   - Replace "lean back" with "Wind-Up" pose
   - Ensure recognizable at 16x16px

2. **Brand Assets**
   - `public/assets/brand/zeno-lean-*.svg` → Rename and replace with "Wind-Up"
   - Create new master illustrations for all three poses

3. **UI Elements**
   - Any in-game sprites using "lean back" → Update to "Wind-Up"

4. **Promotional Materials**
   - Keep approved assets (already in pick/ folder)
   - Create new assets for "Landing" pose

---

## Design Principles (Reinforced)

1. **Superhero Energy, Not Chill Vibes**
   - Every pose should look like Zeno is about to do something amazing
   - Active, not passive
   - Engaged, not relaxed

2. **Arms Are Key**
   - Arms hanging loose = bad
   - Arms in athletic position = good
   - Arms create dynamism and show intent

3. **Coiled Power**
   - Wind-up should look like a spring compressed
   - Body language should suggest explosive potential
   - Low center of gravity = power

4. **Forward Momentum**
   - Even when standing still, Zeno should look ready to move forward
   - No leaning back casually
   - Always oriented toward the challenge

---

## Next Steps

1. Create new "Wind-Up" pose master illustration (replace "lean")
2. Create new "Landing" pose master illustration (missing)
3. Update all app icons with "Wind-Up" pose
4. Generate promotional materials featuring all three poses
5. Update branding documentation to remove "lean" terminology
6. Provide Claude with clear prompts for implementation
